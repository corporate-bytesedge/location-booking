These Terms, together with any additional terms to which you agree when using particular elements of the prms.ts.gov Websites, constitute the entire and exclusive and final statement of the agreement between you and prms.ts.gov with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding any prior agreements or negotiations between you and prms.ts.gov with respect to such subject matter.

prms.ts.gov reserves all rights to its trademarks, service marks and logos, which together with the trademarks, service marks and logos of subsidiaries of prms.ts.gov will be collectively referred to as “prms.ts.gov Marks.
 
No employee or other representative of prms.ts.gov is authorized to grant permission to use prms.ts.gov Marks or to provide guidance in their use, unless licensed within a formal written agreement.  Thus, any promise or other representation with respect to prms.ts.gov Marks by a prms.ts.gov employee in the absence of a formal written agreement cannot be relied upon.
 
The prms.ts.gov Marks are highly valued intellectual property, and therefore prms.ts.gov will take the necessary steps to guard against dilution and the use of third-party marks which are confusingly similar to prms.ts.gov Marks or which are likely to cause confusion with prms.ts.gov Marks.
 
If a formal written agreement licenses one or more of the prms.ts.gov Marks, unless the agreement provides other authorization, the use will be in accordance with the guidelines posted at: 
http://www.prms.ts.gov.com/files/pdf/prms.ts.gov_Corporate_Logo_Guidelines.pdf.
 
prms.ts.gov does not object to the use of the prms.ts.gov Marks (other than logos) to refer specifically to the products of prms.ts.gov.  However, a purely referential use or nominative fair use of the prms.ts.gov Marks must be in plain text.  Qualified legal counsel should be consulted in order to distinguish a referential use from an infringing use.
 
In the United States, registered prms.ts.gov Marks should be designated by the symbol “®”, while unregistered prms.ts.gov Marks should be identified by a “™” designation.  The prms.ts.gov Marks must be used as adjectives, rather than as nouns or verbs.
